# Meta-Mesh: metagenomic data analysis system

Meta-Mesh was designed as an online metagenome search engine.

Due to I did not find a web server to host this online service, and I did not find an opportunity to work in the area of Metagenome.
I release the source of Meta-Mesh online service source code here. This software is not under active development anymore.

Attention: There are a couple of bugs in the code and user information could not be well protected.
